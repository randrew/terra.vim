terra.vim
=========

vim stuff for [terra](http://terralang.org/)

Forked from https://github.com/vim-scripts/terra.vim

Changes
-------

Added ftplugin which sets options similar to Lua

Fork TODO
----------

* Update syntax with stuff similar to Lua

* Update syntax with newer terra changes since original author's fork

* Recognize `.t` as `terra` instead of `tads` without requiring BufEnter in
  user's vimrc

Original author's notes
-----------------------

Based entirely on lua.vim as bundled with my vim 7.3; a big hack, too, but I'm not a Vimscripter.
